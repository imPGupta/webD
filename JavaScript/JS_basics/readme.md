# JavaScript Basics

Let's begin with a simple js program and executing it.

JS programs are run on web browser console. You can open the console in browser.
Type the following code in console and hit enter.

'''
console.log("let's begin with js");

'''

Chaos, the output comes out to be **let's begin with js**

Here console is the object having a function log which is used to print on the console.
