# JavaScript Basics

Let's begin with a simple js program and executing it.

JS programs are run on web browser console. You can open the console in browser.
Type the following code in console and hit enter.

```
console.log("let's begin with js");

```

Chaos, the output comes out to be **let's begin with js**

Here console is the object having a function log which is used to print on the console.


JavaScript can also be included in html code using the following syntax:

```
<script>
	//code goes here
</script>
```

This script can be included in either in head tag or body tag of html.

Javascript can also be written in external file and saved as **.js** extension and included in html using the syntax :

```
		<script src="link of the js file">
		</script>
```
