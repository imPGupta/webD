# JavaScript Basics

Let's begin with a simple js program and executing it.

JS programs are run on web browser console. You can open the console in browser.
Type the following code in console and hit enter.

```
console.log("let's begin with js");

```

Chaos, the output comes out to be **let's begin with js**

Here console is the object having a function log which is used to print on the console.


JavaScript can also be included in html code using the following syntax:

```
<script>
	//code goes here
</script>
```

This script can be included in either in head tag or body tag of html.

Javascript can also be written in external file and saved as **.js** extension and included in html using the syntax :

```
		<script src="link of the js file">
		</script>
```

## Few facts about JS programs:
	- JS is case sensitive ,i.e.  lowercase and uppercase letters are treated differently
	- JS uses the **Unicode** character set, i.e. it covers all the characters, punctuations, and symbols.
	- JS programs consists of statements and each JS statements are composed of ** values, operators, expressions, keywords, and comments **
	- Each statement is separated by a semicolon
	- // is used to comment single line
	- /* ... */ is used to comment multiple lines
	- JS values are of two types : 
		1. Literal :

			These can numbers(with or without zero) or string(string is combination of one or more characters)
		
		2. Variable :

			These are named memory location used to store the value. Variable names are to be unique.

			Variable names are called identifiers and for naming variables there are certain rules to be followed:
			- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
			- Names must begin with a letter
			- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
			- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
			- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
